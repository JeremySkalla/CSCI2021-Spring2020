PROBLEM 1 `age.c'
=================

A
~

  Examine the source code for `age.c'. Compile it using the following
  invocation of `gcc'
  ,----
  | gcc age.c
  `----
  This should create the executable `a.out'. Run this program using the
  invocation.
  ,----
  | ./a.out
  `----
  Perform several runs of the program with the following values and
  paste your output in the space below.
  - Enter 16
  - Enter 18
  - Enter 25
  - Enter 44

skall034@csel-vole-43:/home/skall034/csci2021/hw01 $ gcc age.c
skall034@csel-vole-43:/home/skall034/csci2021/hw01 $ ./a.out
Enter your age in years: 
16
You are 8409600 minutes old.
You're too young to do anything fun.
skall034@csel-vole-43:/home/skall034/csci2021/hw01 $ ./a.out
Enter your age in years: 
18
You are 9460800 minutes old.
You can vote but cannot legally imbibe alcohol.
I bet that hasn't stopped you from trying though...
skall034@csel-vole-43:/home/skall034/csci2021/hw01 $ ./a.out
Enter your age in years: 
25
You are 13140000 minutes old.
You may imbibe alcohol but cannot be president
skall034@csel-vole-43:/home/skall034/csci2021/hw01 $ ./a.out
Enter your age in years: 
44
You are 23126400 minutes old.
You may imbibe alcohol but cannot be president


B
~

  Analyze the code for `age.c' and describe a flaw in the conditional
  structure towards the end that prevents the output:
  ,----
  | You can vote, drink, and be president.
  | Try all three at once!
  `----
  from being printed.

  Alter the code to fix this bug so that for ages 35 and larger, the
  above text is printed. Paste your fixed code for the conditional below
  and test it by recompiling and showing a demo run.

else if( age_years >= 21 && age_years <35){
    printf("You may imbibe alcohol but cannot be president\n");
  }
else if ( age_years >=35) {
    printf("You can vote, drink, and be president.\nTry all three at once!\n");
  }

C
~

  Attempt to enter some absurd ages for the age computation.
  - Enter 5000
  - Enter -5000
  Describe anything strange that seems to be happening based your
  understanding of how basic arithmetic is supposed to work.

  If you happen to know WHY this strangeness is happening, describe it
  below.  If not, you will find out soon.

I don't know why it's happening but 5000 gives me -1666967296 minutes old but says I am old enough to do all 3, and -5000 gives 1666967296 minutes old but says I'm too young to do anything

D
~

  Describe which function is used to print information to the screen.
  Describe how it seems to work to substitute values into output and
  what *format specifier* indicates an integer should be substituted.

It appears that printf is used to display the information, and it substitutes an interger into "%d" I'm assuming

E
~

  Describe what function is used to read typed input interactively from
  a user in the `age.c' program.  Describe anything that seems strange
  about this function or its arguments.

  We will learn in not long why this bit of strangeness is necessary.

It uses scanf, which takes an input of "%d" and then takes that information and puts it into age_years but I'm not sure why it is &age_years instead of just age_years. The whole thing is a little strange


PROBLEM 2 Collatz
=================

A
~

  Examine and compile the code associated with the collatz
  program. There are three files associated with this program.
  - `collatz_funcs.c' which defines two utility functions for computing
    the Collatz sequence
  - `collatz_main.c' which defines a `main()' function to compute a
    Collatz sequence
  - `collatz.h' header file which declares functions in
    `collatz_funcs.c' so that they are known to `collatz_main.c'

  To compile the program, use the following invocation of `gcc'
  ,----
  | gcc -o collatz collatz_funcs.c collatz_main.c
  `----
  This should create the program `collatz' which can be run with
  ,----
  | ./collatz
  `----

  Do so and enter inputs
  - Starting integer 7
  - Show output: 1

  Paste the output below.

skall034@csel-vole-43:/home/skall034/csci2021/hw01 $ gcc -o collatz collatz_funcs.c collatz_main.c
skall034@csel-vole-43:/home/skall034/csci2021/hw01 $ ./collatz
Enter the starting integer: 7
The next value in the Collatz sequence is 22
Show output of steps (0:NO, any other int: yes): 1
Step 0: 7
Step 1: 22
Step 2: 11
Step 3: 34
Step 4: 17
Step 5: 52
Step 6: 26
Step 7: 13
Step 8: 40
Step 9: 20
Step 10: 10
Step 11: 5
Step 12: 16
Step 13: 8
Step 14: 4
Step 15: 2
Step 16: 1
The starting value 7 converged to 1 in 16 steps

B
~

  Determine what the "dash-O" option used above for `gcc -o' does. For
  example, what happens if one runs
  ,----
  | gcc -o GLIPGLOP collatz_funcs.c collatz_main.c
  `----
  instead.  You may wish to use the `ls' command to list the files in
  the current directory.

  Describe what happens if you omit this option `-o' when compiling as
  in
  ,----
  | gcc collatz_funcs.c collatz_main.c
  `----

-o allows you to name the output file instead of just having it be a.out


C
~

  Attempt to compile only the file `collatz_main.c' by doing
  ,----
  | gcc -o something collatz_main.c
  `----

  This should result in an error. Show the output of that error and
  determine why the compilation fails.

skall034@csel-vole-43:/home/skall034/csci2021/hw01 $ gcc -o something collatz_main.c
/tmp/ccwbl1GK.o: In function `main':
collatz_main.c:(.text+0x4d): undefined reference to `collatz_next'
collatz_main.c:(.text+0x9e): undefined reference to `collatz_steps'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

This happens because collatz_funcs.c contains the functions collatz_next and collatz_steps, so there's no function to run. 

D
~

  Attempt to compile only the file `collatz_funcs.c' by doing
  ,----
  | gcc -o something collatz_funcs.c
  `----

  This should result in an error. Show the output of that error and
  determine why the compilation fails.

skall034@csel-vole-43:/home/skall034/csci2021/hw01 $ gcc -o something collatz_funcs.c
/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/7/../../../x86_64-linux-gnu/Scrt1.o: In function `_start':
(.text+0x20): undefined reference to `main'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

I'm going to assume this happens because there's no main function in collatz_funcs.c so it returns an error.

Review Course Syllabus
======================

  Make sure to review the Course Syllabus to acquaint yourself with
  course policies such as the following.
  - The PRIME DIRECTIVE to preserve academic integrity
  - Fair collaboration with other students
  - Late submission policies on assignments (projects, HW, quizzes, lab
    work)
  - Grading criteria and weighting on exams/assignments

Can do good sir :)
